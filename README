NAME
    XML::Atom::FromOWL - export RDF data to Atom

SYNOPSIS
     use LWP::UserAgent;
     use XML::Atom::OWL;
     use XML::Atom::FromOWL;
 
     my $ua       = LWP::UserAgent->new;
     my $r        = $ua->get('http://intertwingly.net/blog/index.atom');
     my $atomowl  = XML::Atom::OWL->new($r->decoded_content, $r->base);
     my $model    = $atomowl->consume->graph;  ## an RDF::Trine::Model
 
     my $exporter = XML::Atom::FromOWL->new;
     print $_->as_xml
            foreach $exporter->export_feeds($model);

DESCRIPTION
    This module reads RDF and writes Atom feeds. It does the reverse of
    XML::Atom::OWL.

  Constructor
    *   "new(%options)"

        Returns a new XML::Atom::FromOWL object.

        There are no valid options at the moment - the hash is reserved for
        future use.

  Methods
    *   "export_feeds($input, %options)"

        Returns a list of feeds found in the input, in no particular order.

        The input may be a URI, file name, RDF::Trine::Model or anything
        else that can be handled by the "rdf_parse" method of
        RDF::TrineShortcuts.

        Each item in the list returned is an XML::Atom::Feed.

    *   "export_feed($input, $subject, %options)"

        As per "export_feeds" but exports just a single feed.

        The subject provided must be an RDF::Trine::Node::Blank or
        RDF::Trine::Node::Resource of type awol:Feed.

    *   "export_entries($input, %options)"

        Returns a list of entries found in the input, in no particular
        order.

        The input may be a URI, file name, RDF::Trine::Model or anything
        else that can be handled by the "rdf_parse" method of
        RDF::TrineShortcuts.

        Each item in the list returned is an XML::Atom::Entry.

    *   "export_entry($input, $subject, %options)"

        As per "export_entry" but exports just a single entry.

        The subject provided must be an RDF::Trine::Node::Blank or
        RDF::Trine::Node::Resource of type awol:Entry.

  RDF Input
    Input is expected to use AtomOwl
    <http://bblfish.net/work/atom-owl/2006-06-06/#>.

  Feed Output
    This module doesn't attempt to enforce many of OWL's semantic
    constraints (e.g. it doesn't enforce that an entry has only one title).
    It relies on XML::Atom::Feed and XML::Atom::Entry for that sort of
    thing, but if your input is sensible that shouldn't be a problem.
